# Habbo Flash Linux install script (made for ChromeOS users)
This script is made for the Linux terminal on ChromeOS but should work on most Linux distributions too when WINE is pre-installed. This is the best option for Chromebooks if it supports the Linux VM option, there are a few other options but they are very laggy. With this method, I had almost no lag.

### Installing this on a Chromebook
1. Enable 'Linux (Beta)' in the settings of your Chromebook if you haven't done this before.
2. When finished, a black terminal screen should pop up. If it doesn't, open the new app 'Terminal'.
3. Type or paste the following command in that screen:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/belieb/HabboFlashLinux/main/HabboFlashInstall.sh && sudo chmod +x HabboFlashInstall.sh && ./HabboFlashInstall.sh
```
4. This is going to install a few things (WINE for Windows apps and the latest Habbo Flash client from Habbo's servers). Click 'Install' when boxes ask for it.
5. When everything is finished, the launcher should now contain an Habbo icon. You're done. Opening the client can take a minute but when it's open, it's running well.

### Video
I made a quick video showing how I installed it on CloudReady (also tested on a real Chromebook before): [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMArVeXmTp4)
